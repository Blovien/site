title: Server-First Development
description: Hytale's networking infrastructure

Hytale uses a master-server methodology, meaning that the server is the ultimate authority
on all game logic, while the client merely handles rendering and input. In effect, Hytale
is considered to use a "thin client," where most burdens are placed on the server, rather
than the client.

This extends to the game UI as well. The UI is controlled by the server, which expands the
capabilities of what you can do with server mods, which is important since client mods are
not supported. This "thin client" approach is primarily beneficial as it makes illegitimate
tampering with game logic much more difficult, compared to if it were handled by the client.
