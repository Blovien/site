description: Customizing UI in Hytale.

UI in Hytale is controlled by the server, meaning you'll be able to modify and display custom
screens. This system is [currently incomplete](https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status#:~:text=We%20already%20have%20asset-driven%20UIs,%20but%20they%20are%20incomplete%20and%20limited.), but it is the method of choice for custom UIs.

The UI system in Hytale uses the following control flow:
1. The server sends UI assets to the client.
2. The client renders the UI.
3. The user interacts with UI (e.g. pressed a button.)
4. The client forwards the click event to the server.
5. The server runs a callback for button clicks.

Because of this system, it's likely that users may experience latency in the UI, since the server
is responsible for handling the functionality of buttons once clicked.

## Differing Implementations

Hytale currently uses 3 different UI implementations, though plans for
"consolidating on NoesisGUI" are currently underway:
- Legacy
  - Uses a custom markup language
- NoesisGUI
  - Uses XAML markup
  - Supports multiple languages
- Unknown 3rd framework
